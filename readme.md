## License text

Liberty License, Version 1.0, February 2017
Copyright <year> <owner>

The work protected herein is free and available for inspection in the immediate artifact and all derivative works.  This license grants permission to any organization or person the rights to use, execute, modify, copy, and republish the covered work (and its derivative works) in accordance with the following rights and limitations:

1. The license is effective on the date of first publication of a work containing this license as published by the work's primary owner.  The license is void when the license text is removed from the protected work AND the work's primary owner publishes the protected work with a different version indicator or a different name.  Until both prior conditions are achieved the license remains in effect even onto derivative works without regard to modifications thereof.

2. This licensee agreement provides no assurances or guarantees the protected work is clean of intellectual property violations.  In the case of intellectual property violations, as determined by applicable law, this license is void and all associated rights and protections are henceforth lost.

3. Subsequent licensing of the protected work is not authorized in any form or capacity while this license remains in effect.

4. The protected work is free and royalty free immediately and in all derivative forms.

5. The protected work is open to inclusion in a larger body of work, as a derivative, that is not free provided the larger body is charging for qualities not associated or attributable to the protected work.

6. This license does not void claims of patentability or novelty expressed by the protected work.  This license does, however, void all fees and royalties associated with such claims.

7. This license does not void fees or expenses associated with warranty, support, maintenance, or other means of human labor upon instances and derivatives of the work provided that such fees do not limit or interfere with access, publication, execution, or modification of the protected work.

8. Modifications of the protected work, immediately or in derivative form, are authorized without the permission or knowledge of the work's primary owner.

9. Republication of the protected work is authorized without the permission or knowledge of the work's primary owner.  Publication and republication of the protected work is limited to a means of direct access according to a given protocol.  Indirect access is not authorized.  For example the protected work is authorized for access by any web address whether directly in a user-agent application or as a download, such as a git clone operation.  The protected work may also be accessed from a library or database via a standard protocol, for example ISBN, URN, or URL with query string.  Examples of unauthorized publication include named registries, as named identifiers do not constitute a standard means of addressability or standard protocol access in a universally equitable way.  HTTP 301 redirection, or other means of address obfuscation are indirect means of access, and thus are not an authorized means of publication.

10. Republication by any means, including in violation of the prior expressed limitation, is authorized provided the protected work is indirectly republished due to inclusion, as a dependency, in a larger separated AND unrelated body of work.  The protected work must be included into the actual download or transfer of the large body of work for this exclusion to apply.

11. This license agreement voids all statements of warranty, reservation, performance, and expressions of fitness whether stated or implied provided the intent of this protected work is not malicious according to applicable law.  No publisher, owner, or maintainer is liable for damages or harms incurred by the execution or mere presence of this protected work whether direct, indirect, or consequential.  In the case a defect or interference were to arise the costs associated with sanitation or resolution rests entirely upon YOU, the consumer of the protected work, regardless of gross negligence from any party.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

12. Use of, execution of, and presence of the protected work whether directly or in derivative form acknowledges agreement to the rights and limitations expressed by this license agreement.  In the case where violations to this license arise injured parties may seek damages.
